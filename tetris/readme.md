Project from 2009.

I was trying to find a new job in the web dev business, but nothing showed my 
JavaScript capabilities, other than a bit of form validation and mouse handling.

I also needed to learn jQuery.

So I created Tetris in JavaScript using jQuery.

Silly combination when you think about it now.
